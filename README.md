# Goal

Create a dataset of simple images and icons to train toy text->image models on. This could be a good test dataset for low-compute experiments on text->image, since the problem should be a lot easier than generating natural images.

# Usage

Set the `LAION_ICONS_DIR` environment variable to the data directory of the download.
